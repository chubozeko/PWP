## API Client for EatHelp
<strong>TODO: Implement, test and document a client that uses the API [<a href="https://czeko.atlassian.net/browse/PWP-38">PWP-38</a>]</strong>

Test the client implementation with the API and take screenshots to add to the documentation.

Create a <strong>README.md</strong> file in the client directory containing:

<ul>
    <li>Dependencies (external libraries)</li>
    <li>How to setup/install the client</li>
    <li>How to configure and run the client</li>
    <li>How to run the different tests of your client (if you have implemented unit testing)</li>
</ul>
<strong>NOTE: Your code MUST be clearly documented. Check Exercise 4 for examples of how to document the code. In addition, should be clear which is the code you have implemented yourself and which is the code that you have borrowed from other sources.</strong>
