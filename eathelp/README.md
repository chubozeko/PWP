<strong>TODO: Document API framework setup [<a href="https://czeko.atlassian.net/browse/PWP-20">PWP-20</a>]</strong>

Create a <strong>README.md</strong> file containing:

<ul>
    <li>Dependencies (external libraries)</li>
    <li>How to setup the framework.</li>
    <li>How to populate and setup the database.</li>
    <li>How to setup (e.g. modifying any configuration files) and run your RESTful API.</li>
    <li>The URL to access your API (usually <em>nameofapplication/api/version/</em>)=&gt; the path to your application.</li>
</ul>
<strong>NOTE: Your code MUST be clearly documented. </strong>For each public method/function you must provide: a short description of the method, input parameters, output parameters, exceptions (when the application can fail and how to handle such fail). 
&nbsp;<strong>In addition should be clear which is the code you have implemented yourself and which is the code that you have borrowed from other sources. Always provide a link to the original source. This includes links to the course material.</strong>
