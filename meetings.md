# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE:** Monday, 02.05.2022 12:00 - 12:30
* **ASSISTANTS:** Mika Oja
* **GROUP MEMBER ATTENDANCE:** Chubo Zeko

### Minutes 
- The group had implemented the tasks for Deadline 1 and Deadline 2, as well as Exercise 1 and 2.
- Mika reviewed the state of the project work by looking through the Wiki pages on GitHub, and viewed the completed exercises on Lovelace.
- Mika asked about the work allocation between the team, and Chubo spoke about how the work was delegated between members.
- Mika discussed how feasible it was to complete this project by the end of the May, as well as proposing alternative ways to completing the course.

### Action points
- Since the Deadline 1 and Deadline 2 tasks were already completed, it was suggested that we should complete at least Deadline 3 
(the complete API implementation) and part of Deadline 4, which is the API documentation. 
- Additionally, we should complete all the Exercises, as well as Deadline 6, which is the overall analysis of the project and feedback of the course.
- Mika also suggested that the group should have a meeting and decide on which Grade we are aiming for, so that we can prioritize those tasks.
- Once we have implemented and documented what we could before the end of May, we need to arrange a final evaluation meeting.
- If we wish to improve our grade, we could take the course during the Summer period to continue working on the project.
